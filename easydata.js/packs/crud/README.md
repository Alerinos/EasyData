# @easydata/crud (part of EasyData library)

## What is EasyData?

EasyData is an open-source library that allows you to simplify data management tasks in your web applications. Here we are talking about usual CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) operations first of all.

EasyData introduces a declarative approach to building a user interface for most data operations. 
You simply describe your data: entities (tables), attributes (fields), relationships between them, data types, constraints, etc., and EasyData automatically, at run-time renders the necessary forms and dialogs to view, search and edit the data.

## What is @easydata/crud package?

This package is a part EasyData.JS library. It contains UI widgets and views for implementing UI for CRUD (create/retrieve/update/delete) operations over your database.

## How to start?

As it was said before, @easydata NPM packages make up the client-side part of EasyData. It means you need something on your server-side to utilize EasyData in your project. The possible options are:

### 1. ASP.NET Core projects

To start with ASP.NET Core backend you can simply visit [EasyData repository on GitHub](https://github.com/KorzhCom/EasyData/), try one of the samples included in that repository. After that, you can follow [the instructions](https://github.com/KorzhCom/EasyData/blob/master/README.md) published there to use EasyData with your own project.

### 2. Any other backend platform.

Sorry, but it's not possible yet :(

Please [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/KorzhCom/EasyData/issues) (or vote for an existing one) to encourage us to add the support for your platform of choice faster.

## Documentation

We've just made the first release of the library, so there is only a [README document on GitHub](https://github.com/KorzhCom/EasyData/blob/master/README.md) with some basic instructions and some [sample projects](https://github.com/KorzhCom/EasyData/tree/master/samples) you can try to run and to play with.
